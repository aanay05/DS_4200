    <h1>Aanay Anandpara</h1>
    <p> I'm Aanay Anandpara, a Data Science and Finance student at Northeastern University, I thrive on applying analytical skills to solve complex problems, blending my knowledge of programming languages like Python, SQL and R with financial software expertise.
      My professional experience includes a transformative role at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, where I enhanced portfolio management and operational workflow through innovative data analysis tools in the FI department. I'm also actively engaged in mentoring and leadership roles within my academic community, fostering growth and learning.
      Outside of my career and studies, I have a passion for exploring financial markets, coding, and equestrian sports. I find balance through travel, photography, and community service, which keep me connected and inspired. </p>
